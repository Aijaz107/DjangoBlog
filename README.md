My first website code. I built a blog website using Django which is a powerful python framework.
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view archectural pattern.
Django is a collection of Python libs allowing you to quickly and efficiently create a quality Web application, 
and is suitable for both frontend and backend.
This website contains posts related to technology, sports, education, news and many more.
It has a home page, about page and a contact page. The contact page contains a contact form from which users can communicate and
send their messages.
